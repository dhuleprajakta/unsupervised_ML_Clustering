# 🌀 Unsupervised ML - Clustering Projects

This repository contains **Unsupervised Machine Learning** projects focused on **Clustering**. These projects group similar data points without predefined labels to uncover hidden patterns and insights 📊.

## 🚀 Techniques Used

- 📍 **K-Means Clustering** – Partition data into K distinct clusters.
- 🧩 **DBSCAN** – Discover clusters based on data density.
- 🌳 **Hierarchical Clustering** – Create a hierarchy of nested clusters.

## 📂 Projects Included

- 🌸 **Iris Data** – Cluster flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.
- 🛍️ **Mall Customer Segmentation** – Group customers by spending habits and behavior.
- 🍷 **Wine Quality Clustering** – Analyze chemical properties to categorize wine types.

---

📌 These projects demonstrate the power of clustering for segmentation, pattern recognition, and data-driven decision-making.
